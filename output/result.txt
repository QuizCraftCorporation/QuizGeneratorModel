[0]


How does a process in user mode request a system service?
By executing a trap instruction|By calling a library procedure|By sending a message to the operating system|By executing a system call
[0]


What is the purpose of a system call?

[0]


What is the read system call?
A system call used to read data from a file|A library procedure used to read data from a file|A method to execute multiple instructions at once|A way to transfer control to the operating system
[0]


What happens if a system call encounters an error?
The count variable is set to -1 and the error number is put in a global variable|The count variable is set to 0 and the error number is put in a local variable|The count variable is set to the number of bytes read|The program terminates
[0]


What is the purpose of pushing parameters onto the stack before making a system call?
To prepare the calling program for the read library procedure|To pass parameters by reference|To switch from user mode to kernel mode|To execute a TRAP instruction
[0]


Why is the second parameter passed by reference in the read call?
To pass the contents of the buffer|For historical reasons|To indicate the address of the buffer|To switch from user mode to kernel mode
[2]


What does the library procedure do before executing a TRAP instruction?
Pushes the parameters onto the stack|Puts the system-call number in a place where the operating system expects it|Executes a procedure-call instruction|Switches from user mode to kernel mode
[1]


What is the purpose of the TRAP instruction in making a system call?
To switch into kernel mode|To give an absolute address of the procedure|To jump to an arbitrary address|To save the return address on the stack
[0]


What is the difference between the TRAP instruction and a procedure call instruction?
TRAP instruction changes the mode to kernel mode, while procedure call instruction does not|TRAP instruction gives an index into a table in memory containing jump addresses, while procedure call instruction gives an absolute or relative address of the procedure|TRAP instruction can jump to an arbitrary address, while procedure call instruction cannot|TRAP instruction saves the return address on the stack, while procedure call instruction does not
[0]


What does the kernel code do following the TRAP instruction?
Examines the system-call number and dispatches to the correct system-call handler|Saves the return address on the stack|Switches into user mode|Jumps to an arbitrary address
[0]


What happens once the system-call handler completes its work?
Control may be returned to the user-space library procedure at the instruction following the TRAP instruction|The kernel code switches into user mode|The system-call handler saves the return address on the stack|The system-call handler jumps to an arbitrary address
[0]


What is the purpose of the fork call in POSIX?
To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To open a file|To get a file's status information
[0]


What happens to the original process and its copy after a fork call?
They continue to run together|They go their separate ways|The copy becomes the new parent process|The original process terminates
[1]


What is the value returned by a fork call?
The child's PID|The parent's PID|Zero in the child and the child's PID in the parent|The process' status
[2]


What is shared between the parent and child processes after a fork call?
All variables|Program text|Registers|File descriptors
[1]


What is the purpose of the waitpid call in POSIX?
To create a child process|To wait for a child process to terminate|To replace a process' core image|To get a file's status information
[1]


What is the purpose of the mkdir system call?
To remove an empty directory|To create a new directory|To change the working directory|To mount a file system
[1]


What is the return code of system calls if an error has occurred?
-1|0|1|2
[0]


What is the purpose of the chdir system call?
To remove a directory entry|To change a file's protection bits|To send a signal to a process|To change the working directory
[3]


What is the purpose of the waitpid system call?
To wait for a child process to finish|To create a new directory|To mount a file system|To remove a directory entry
[0]


What system call is used by the shell to execute a user command?
fork|waitpid|execve
[2]


What is the purpose of waitpid in the shell's use of fork?
to wait for the child process to exit|to execute the user command|to display the prompt on the screen
[0]


How many parameters does execve have in the most general case?
1|2|3
[2]


What is the purpose of the exec system call?
To execute a new program within a process|To create a new process|To terminate a process|To allocate memory for a process
[0]


What is the first parameter of the main function in C programs?
argc|argv|envp|main
[0]


What is the second parameter of the main function in C programs?
argc|argv|envp|main
[1]


What is the third parameter of the main function in C programs?
argc|argv|envp|main
[2]


What is the purpose of the environment array in C programs?
