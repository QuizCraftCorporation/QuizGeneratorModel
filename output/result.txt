[0]


What approach has been chosen to understand what operating systems really do?

[1]


What is the purpose of the procedure library provided for making system calls?
to make it possible to make system calls from C programs and other languages|to provide security measures for user programs|to manage computer resources|none of the above
[0]


What is a system call?
A special kind of procedure call that enters the kernel|A regular function call in C programs|A way to execute multiple instructions at once|A method to transfer control to the operating system
[0]


What happens when a process running a user program needs a system service?
It executes a trap instruction to transfer control to the operating system|It continues running the user program|It terminates the program|It enters kernel mode
[0]


What is the purpose of a system call?
To request a service from the operating system|To execute a series of instructions at once|To terminate a program|To enter kernel mode
[0]


How is a system call invoked from a C program?
By calling a library procedure with the same name as the system call|By executing a trap instruction|By entering kernel mode|By calling a regular function in C programs
[0]


What happens if a system call cannot be carried out?
Count is set to -1 and the error number is put in a global variable, errno|The program terminates|The system call is repeated|The operating system enters kernel mode
[0]


What is the purpose of pushing parameters onto the stack before making a system call?
To prepare for calling the library procedure|To switch from user mode to kernel mode|To pass the contents of the buffer|To execute a TRAP instruction
[0]


Why is the second parameter passed by reference in the read call?
To pass the address of the buffer|To pass the contents of the buffer|To switch from user mode to kernel mode|To execute a TRAP instruction
[0]


What is the purpose of the TRAP instruction in the read call?
To switch from user mode to kernel mode|To pass the contents of the buffer|To execute a procedure-call instruction|To push parameters onto the stack
[0]


What is the purpose of the system-call number in the read call?
To indicate which system call is being made|To pass the contents of the buffer|To switch from user mode to kernel mode|To execute a TRAP instruction
[0]


Why do C and C++ compilers push parameters onto the stack in reverse order?
For historical reasons related to printf|To prepare for calling the library procedure|To switch from user mode to kernel mode|To pass the contents of the buffer
[0]


What is the purpose of the TRAP instruction in making a system call?
To switch into kernel mode|To give an absolute address of the procedure|To jump to an arbitrary address|To save the return address on the stack
[0]


How does the TRAP instruction differ from a procedure call instruction?
It switches into kernel mode as a side effect|It gives an absolute address of the procedure|It jumps to an arbitrary address|It does not save the return address on the stack
[0]


What does the kernel code do following the TRAP instruction?
Examines the system-call number and dispatches to the correct system-call handler|Saves the return address on the stack|Switches into user mode|Returns control to the user-space library procedure
[0]


How is the correct system-call handler determined?
Via a table of pointers to system-call handlers indexed on system-call number|By jumping to a single fixed location|By using an 8-bit field in the instruction|By examining the return address on the stack
[0]


What happens once the system-call handler completes its work?
Control may be returned to the user-space library procedure at the instruction following the TRAP instruction|The kernel code switches into user mode|The return address is saved on the stack|The system-call number is examined
