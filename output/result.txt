it takes longer to differentiate actions|the regret of randomly selected actions is smaller|mean rewards arecloser than for a typical randomly sampled <unk>

What is the shortest pathproblem?
Example 4.1|Example 1.3|Example 1.4|Example 1.2

How many stages are in the graph?
ten|six|184,756|twenty

What is the plot of regret?
/epsilon1-greedy exploration is not judicious in howit selects paths to explore|the performance of TS con-verges quickly to optimal

independent of that of Example 4.1|different from that of Example 4.2|identical to that of Example 4.1

What is the common factor that causes correlations among travel times in the binomial bridge?

What is the difference between the two models?
log-Gaussian distribution|observation generation|model differences

What is the reward in the model?

What is the feedback from the driver?
whether the driver was satisfied|whether the route was desirable

What is the limiting distribution of a Markov chain?
its posterior distribution|its stationary distribution

What is the prevailing vector taken to be?

What is the behavior of the Laplace approximation not invariant to?

What is the Langevin Monte Carlo method?
uses a log-concave probability density function|uses a Euler discretization|uses a Gaussian distribution|uses gradient information about the target distribution

What is the name of the method that uses sampled minibatches of data to compute approximate rather than exact gradients?
Markov chain|Gradient ascent|Welling and Teh|Langevin Monte Carlo

What is the logposterior density?
is the same as that of the prior chain|is the same as that of the posterior chain|becomes ill-conditioned in later time periods

What is the difference between Gibbs sampling, Langevin Monte Carlo, and bootstrap?
the computation time required per time period is fixed|the computation time required per time period grows as time progresses
