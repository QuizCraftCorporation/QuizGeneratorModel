[0]


Why should programs always check the results of a system call?
To see if an error occurred|To speed up the execution of the program|To avoid making additional system calls|To ensure that the program is running in user mode
[0]


What is the purpose of the fork call in POSIX?

[0]


What is the value returned by the fork call?

[0]


What is the purpose of the open call?
To open a file for reading, writing, or both|To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To get a file's status information
[0]


What is the purpose of the close call?
To close an open file|To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To get a file's status information
[0]


What is the purpose of the read call?
To read data from a file into a buffer|To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To get a file's status information
[0]


What is the purpose of the write call?
To write data from a buffer into a file|To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To get a file's status information
[0]


What is the purpose of the lseek call?
To move the file pointer|To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To get a file's status information
[0]


What is the purpose of the stat call?
To get a file's status information|To create a new process|To terminate process execution|To open a file
[0]


What is the purpose of the mkdir system call?
To create a new directory|To remove an empty directory|To mount a file system|To change the working directory
[0]


What is the return code for system calls if an error has occurred?

[0]


How is the data segment of a process expanded?
Automatically as needed|By using the brk system call|By using the malloc library procedure|By using the exit system call
[1]


Why is the brk system call not defined by the POSIX standard?
Programmers are encouraged to use the malloc library procedure instead|It is too complex to standardize|It is not used frequently enough to warrant standardization|It is only used by low-level system processes
