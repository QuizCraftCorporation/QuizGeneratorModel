What are the two main functions of operating systems?
providing abstractions to user programs and managing the computer's resources
creating, writing, reading, and deleting files
dealing with vague generalities and specific systems
issuing system calls and using assembly code
#####

What is the purpose of a system call?
To transfer control to the operating system
To execute multiple instructions at a time
To read data from a file

#####
To transfer control to the operating system

What is the purpose of pushing parameters onto the stack before making a system call?
To pass the parameters to the library procedure
